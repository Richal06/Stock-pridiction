# Stock-pridiction
This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. The code utilizes historical stock price data from a CSV file (in this case, AAPL.csv), preprocesses the data, trains the LSTM model, makes predictions, and evaluates the model's performance.
Dependencies:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Install the dependencies using pip
Usage:
Clone this repository or download the script stock_prediction.py and the CSV file AAPL.csv.
Ensure that you have the necessary Python dependencies installed.
Replace the placeholder values in the code with your Tiingo API key (if applicable) and adjust any other parameters as needed.
Run the script stock_prediction.py.
The script will train the LSTM model, make predictions, and evaluate the model's performance.
Results will be displayed, including the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both training and test datasets, and visualizations of the predicted stock prices.
